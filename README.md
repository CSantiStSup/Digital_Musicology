<p>In order to provide insight on the relationship between valence and complexity, we will use the work of Artemy Kolchinsky, Nakul Dhande,<br>
Kengjeun Park and Yong-Yeol Ahn entitled “<em>The Minor fall, the Major<br>
lift: inferring emotional<br>
valence of musical chords<br>
through lyrics</em>” as a sarting point. Given the valence of songs, we will proceed to the analysis of complexity of both lyrics and musical structure. The lexical complexity will be established based on syntax, sentence structure and vocabulary. We will use the methodology established  by Suma Bhat and Su-Youn Yoon  in their paper “<em>Automatic assessment of syntactic complexity for spontaneous<br>
speech scoring</em>”. For the musical structure, we will inspire ourselves of “<em>Toward a Harmonic Complexity of Musical Pieces</em>” written by Ladislav Marsk, Jaroslav Pokorny, and Martin Ilck. This will allow us to proceed to the analysis of chords and then we will make use of the MIDI formats to work with progressions and melodies.<br>
Because the paper on emotional valence is used a starting point, we will at first work with the <em>Ultimate Guitar</em> dataset which will be completed by elements from <em>MusicBrainz</em></p>
